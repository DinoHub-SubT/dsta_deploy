# Convenience function for moving up levels in the path to the current working directory.
# Synopsis:
#     `up [n]` moves n levels up in the directory hierarchy; default is 1.
#     `up dirname` changes to the closest ancestral directory by that name, regardless of case.
#     `up absolutepath` changes to the specified absolute path; primarily used with command completion (see below).
# Additionally, if command completion via _complete_up() is in effect (<tab> represents pressing the tab key):
#      `up [n]<tab>` replaces n with the absolute path of the directory n levels up (default is 1).
#      `up dirnameprefix<tab>` replaces dirnameprefix with the absolute path of the closest ancestral directory whose name starts with the specified name prefix, terminated with '/'.
#         Whether dirnameprefix is matched case-insensitively or not depends on whether case-insensitive command completion is turned on globally via ~/.inputrc or /etc/inputrc.
#       In both cases the completed absolute path ends in '/', allowing you to optionally continue completion based on that path's subdirectories.
# Notes:
#   - Directory names with characters that need escaping when unquoted (such as spaces) are handled correctly.
#   - For command completion, to specify names that need escaping when unquoted, specify them escaped rather than quoted;
#     e.g., `up my \di<tab>' to match 'my dir' in the ancestral path.
