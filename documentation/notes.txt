#1 check the .bashrc, make sure all exports are accounted for and accurate.

#2 check the /etc/rc.local and network settings from there. On the planning-pc, ignore all iptable commands... that is for something else. (but check the forwarding line and the route line)

#3 checkout the route -n output and make sure things are getting routed.

#4 for easier testing:
 - use roslaunch planning_workspace fkie_debug.launch which will sync everything!
 - rostopic echo /test
 - rostopic pub /test std_msgs/String "hellossh robot@planning-pc!" -r 10

#5 Make sure you reset /etc/hosts on the planning-pc and maybe mtatum-pc

#6 Continue being awesome (*strikes pose*) (*puts on sunglasses*) (*walks into wall*) (*still cool*)
